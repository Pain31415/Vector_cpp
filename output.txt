My favourite dish is borscht. I first tried it in childhood and love it until now!

There are many vegetables: carrots, beetroots, onions, and beans. But also there is meat. The borscht is red and tasty. My mother usually cooks it on weekends.

I also love pizza, salads, and pasta. But borscht is my favourite!
